todo

- add demo/test
- start

  - entry point, to prompt to add a file
  - if nav fails (file diesnt exist), show a 404 page kinda
  - add dev mode like https://expo.github.io/router/docs/features/linking

- `posts/[id]` works with files: `posts/[id].jsx`
- `posts/[id]/other` works with files: `posts/[id]/other.jsx`
- the two above, work together side by side
- `posts/[id]` doesnt work with files: `posts/[id]/index.jsx`
